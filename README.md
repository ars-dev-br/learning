# Learning OCaml

This is a repository where I'll commit code I write while I learn OCaml.
Currently, I'm reading [Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org/).  You
should check it out if you interested in learning OCaml too.

If you wondering if or why you should learn it, this
[retrospective](http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/06/06/python-to-ocaml-retrospective/)
of porting [0install](http://0install.net) from Python to OCaml by Thomas
Leonard might be a good start.
[This comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7766315) on Hacker News may
also interest you.

One last note: use `corebuild` to build the samples.  For instance, `freq.ml`
may be compiled with `corebuild freq.byte` or `corebuild freq.native`.
